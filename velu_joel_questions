%%How to rebuild initramfs

Make backup
    # cp /boot/initramfs-<kernelVersion>.img /boot/initramfs-<kernelVersion>.img.bak
Build Initramfs
    # dracut -f /boot/initramfs-<kernelVersion>.img  <kernelVersion>
grep initrd /boot/loader/entries/*
grep initrd /etc/grub2.cfg

Options
Options are dependent on the file system.

You may use "defaults" here and some typical options may include : 

Ubuntu 8.04 and later uses relatime as default for linux native file systems. You can find a discussion of relatime here : http://lwn.net/Articles/244829. This relates to when and how often the last access time of the current version of a file is updated, i.e. when it was last read.
defaults = rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.
ntfs/vfat = permissions are set at the time of mounting the partition with umask, dmask, and fmask and can not be changed with commands such as chown or chmod.
I advise dmask=027,fmask=137 (using umask=000 will cause all your files to be executable). More permissive options would be dmask=000,fmask=111.
For mounting samba shares you can specify a username and password, or better a credentials file. The credentials file contains should be owned by root.root with permissions = 0400 .

Common options :
sync/async - All I/O to the file system should be done (a)synchronously.
auto - The filesystem can be mounted automatically (at bootup, or when mount is passed the -a option). This is really unnecessary as this is the default action of mount -a anyway.
noauto - The filesystem will NOT be automatically mounted at startup, or when mount passed -a. You must explicitly mount the filesystem.
dev/nodev - Interpret/Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file system.
exec / noexec - Permit/Prevent the execution of binaries from the filesystem.
suid/nosuid - Permit/Block the operation of suid, and sgid bits.
ro - Mount read-only.
rw - Mount read-write.
user - Permit any user to mount the filesystem. This automatically implies noexec, nosuid,nodev unless overridden.
nouser - Only permit root to mount the filesystem. This is also a default setting.
defaults - Use default settings. Equivalent to rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async.
_netdev - this is a network device, mount it after bringing up the network. Only valid with fstype nfs.
For specific options with specific file systems see:

Dump
This field sets whether the backup utility dump will backup file system. If set to "0" file system ignored, "1" file system is backed up.
Dump is seldom used and if in doubt use 0.

Pass (fsck order)
Fsck order is to tell fsck what order to check the file systems, if set to "0" file system is ignored.

Often a source of confusion, there are only 3 options :
0 == do not check.
1 == check this partition first.
2 == check this partition(s) next


Yum update vs yum upgrade

update: Updates packages to their recent version.
upgrade: Upgrades installed packages by replacing or removing the old ones.



Xfs vs ext4 

1. XFS is optimized for large file transfers and parallel I/O operations, while ext4 is optimized for general-purpose use with a focus on security.
2. XFS supports larger file sizes and volumes, while ext4 supports advanced file and directory-level permissions.
3. XFS uses a more advanced journaling system and is better suited for environments that deal with a large number of small files.
4. XFS filesystem is better for multiple read/write threads, while ext4 is better for single read/write thread.
5. XFS is not as widely supported as ext4, and may not be compatible with all operating systems.
